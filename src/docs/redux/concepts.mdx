## Action Names

Action names are strings used by reducer to determine with action should be run.

```ts
const ADD_POST = 'ADD_POST'
```

## Reducer

Reducer is a pure function that accepts state and action and return new computed state.

```ts
export default function reducer(state = {}, action = {}) {
  if (action.type === SET_PLAYERS_INFO) {
    // do reducer stuff
  }

  if (action.type === UPDATE_PLAYER_POSITION_CORDS && action.cords.x && action.cords.y) {
    return {
      ...state,
      playerCords: action.cords,
    }
  }

  default: return state;
}
```

## Action Creators

To make changes to redux store state we use ```dispatch``` method that accepts object with one required property ```type``` and unlimited optional properties with data.
Instead of dispatching with plain objects it's better to create functions that accepts parameters and returns objects. This way we have cleaner UI,
meaningful names and hints with accepted parameters

```ts
// worse
store.dispatch({
  { type: SET_PLAYERS_INFO, playersInfo }
})

// better
export function setPlayersInfo(playersInfo) {
  return { type: SET_PLAYERS_INFO, playersInfo };
}

store.dispatch(setPlayersInfo(playersInfo))
```

## Thunks

Thunks are methods that accept parameters and return async methods that can interact with ```dispatch``` and ```getState``` methods.
They are often used to populate store with outside data. We can chain Thunks.

```ts
export const fetchPlayerInfo = (playerId) => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const response = await client.get(`/player/${playerId}`);

  if (response.data.player) {
    dispatch(updatePlayer(response.data.player))
  }
}
```

## Selectors

Redux state should be as minimal as possible and derive additional values from selectors. Filtering, sorting, mapping etc
should be done in selectors that return computed data.

```ts
export function getPlayerUnitVector(state) {
  const { playerCords } = state;
  const { x, y } = playerCords;

  const vectorLength = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x) + Math.pow(y));

  return {
    x: x / vectorLength,
    y: y / vectoreLength,
  }
}
```
