title: Repository pattern
---

This pattern is used to separate server interface manipulation from client and holding it in one place. By using this pattern we
make it easy to use fetching, adding, removing items from database because implementation is hidden and reusable.


## Structure

I like to hold it in ```repository``` folder where every subfolder is one module of repository and index file to import them to one default export

Every module contains one index, as many submodules as needed and types files


## Example module

```tsx
  export default class Players {
    private baseUrl = '/players';

    public async getAll(): Promise<Players> {
        return API.get(this.baseUrl);
    }

    public async getPlayersByIds(playerIds: string[]): Promise<Players> {
        const cfg = {
          playerIds: playerIds.join(','),
        };

        return API.get(path.join(this.baseUrl, 'players'), cfg);
    }

    public async getPlayerDetails(
        playerId: string,
    ): Promise<PlayerDetails> {
        return API.get(path.join(this.baseUrl, 'details', playerId));
    }
  }
```

## Example index

```tsx
import Players from '/players';
import Teams from '/teams';

export default {
  players: new Players(),
  teams: new Teams(),
};
```

## Example usage

```tsx
import repository from '/repository';

const players = await repositoy.players.getPlayersByIds([120, 121, 500]);
```
