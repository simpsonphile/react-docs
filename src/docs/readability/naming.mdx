## Naming conventions

- Component's file names, component's default export, classes should be written in PascalCase,
- other files should be written in kebab-case,
- variables, functions should be written in camelCase
- Constants should be written in UpperCase,

Component file names should be the same as component default export names

## More meaningful names

- boolean variables should start with has, is, etc.
- functions should start with verb e.g: get, put, add, filter etc.

## Component names

Most IDEs sort files by names so it's good idea to name component files with most important noun for better navigation. This way components are grouped

```
// good
components
 ┣ ButtonBase
 ┣ ButtonPrimary
 ┣ ButtonPrimaryShort
 ┣ ListBase
 ┗ ListPrimary

 // bad
components
 ┣ BaseButton
 ┣ BaseList
 ┣ PrimaryButton
 ┣ PrimaryList
 ┗ PrimaryShortButton
```

## Type names (not sure)

Prefix interface with I and types with T
