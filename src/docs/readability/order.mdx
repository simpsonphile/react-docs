title: Order
---

By sticking to the same order convention we make finding easier


## Import order

I like to group orders in such:

- external import like node_modules
- internal global imports like other components, plugins etc.
- locale imports like subcomponents, types etc.

## Props order

- primitives
- objects
- functions

## Component's body

- props destructuring
- variables, state from hooks
- methods
- hooks like useEffect
- returns
